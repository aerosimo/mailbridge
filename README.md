### Prerequisites

>- **Apache Tomcat 11**: is the application server used during development, but any Jakarta EE 10-compliant server should work.
>- **Java 25**: Ensure you have Java 23 installed as TomEE 10 targets Jakarta EE 10.
>- **Maven**: The project uses Maven for dependency management with any IDE of choice.

### Dependencies

The required dependencies are defined in `pom.xml`. Below are the key dependencies:

- **Jakarta EE 10 API**: Provides JAX-WS support.

### Building and Running the Application

## Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aerosimo/mailbridge.git
    cd mailbridge
    ```

2. **Build the project using Maven**:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. **Deploy the WAR file**:

   After building the project, deploy the generated `WAR` file from the `target/` directory into the `webapps/` folder of your preferred Jakarta EE 10-compatible server.

4. **Start your preferred Jakarta EE 10-compatible server**:

   Start server and access the application:

    - REST Service: http://localhost:8080/mailbridge/api/bridge/dispatch
    - Web Interface: `http://localhost:8080/mailbridge/index.jsp`
